        Serving up insights for the Solana Ecosystem
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        While there are several premier on-chain intelligence platforms out
        there (Nansen, Arkham), these tools emphasize Ethereum/EVM-based chains,
        and give just a nod to the Solana ecosystem. Solana is a leading chain,
        and it deserves tools that do more than these other platforms currently
        offer. Gelato is unique as it takes a Solana-centric (solanic?) approach
        to handling and presenting data.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        While Ethereum's dark forest is mostly well-lit now, Solana users still
        don't enjoy great visibility. Our work tracking down exchange wallets
        and whales on-chain has prepared us to create this product. While other
        tools may try to be everything to everyone, Gelato is more boutique,
        leading you through hand-curated data to inform your path through
        Solana's neon forest.
